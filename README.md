Course Objective for Task Management App

 The **course objective** for a Java project like this "Enhanced Task Management App" would be focused on teaching students how to:

1. **Develop Java GUI Applications**: This project emphasizes creating interactive, user-friendly graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using the **Swing** library in Java, helping students learn how to design forms, handle user inputs, and display data dynamically.
   
2. **Implement Task Management Features**: The app includes functionality such as task creation, deletion, updating, and searching, allowing students to understand the basic principles of task management systems and their real-world applications.

3. **File Handling and Data Persistence**: By implementing the **save** and **load** features, students will learn how to store and retrieve data from files, using serialization to persist tasks, which is crucial for real-world applications that require data storage.

4. **Table Management**: The use of `JTable` and `DefaultTableModel` allows students to gain experience with **tabular data presentation**, sorting, and updating cells, which is essential for creating data-driven applications.

5. **Event-Driven Programming**: The project helps students practice **event-driven programming**, as various user actions (e.g., adding, deleting, marking tasks as complete) trigger responses in the form of event listeners, providing a hands-on understanding of how user actions are processed.

6. **Error Handling and User Feedback**: Students learn to implement user feedback mechanisms (e.g., error dialogs using `JOptionPane`), ensuring that the app provides clear communication when things go wrong, improving user experience and robustness.

7. **Object-Oriented Design**: The project follows **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles, encouraging students to structure their code in a way that is modular, reusable, and maintainable.

8. **Java Collections Framework**: By using `Vector` for task storage and manipulation, the project introduces students to the **Java Collections Framework**, helping them understand how to work with dynamic data structures.

Overall, the objective is to equip students with the knowledge and skills required to build interactive, data-driven Java applications with file handling, event-driven programming, and basic GUI development.
